# TOMST data from the ICE-HEL - Impacts of Carbon Emissions: High Elevations & Latitudes project

Understanding the impacts of climate change on terrestrial carbon (C) globally is complex. Although high latitudes and elevations are expected to warm more rapidly and store more C, there are significant regional differences, particularly with lower expected storage in the Southern Hemisphere. These differences, combined with a lack of information from the South, lead to considerable uncertainties in the global C budget, highlighting the need for innovative, integrative research to fill knowledge gaps on C cycling in a changing world. 

The functions of plants and microbes are critical to terrestrial C cycles, as both depend on access to moisture and temperatures above freezing. However, our understanding of how these functions shift during freeze/thaw threshold events is still limited, as is our knowledge of their responses to decreased snowpack and altered snowmelt timing. 

In ecosystems at high latitudes and elevations, extreme temperatures dominate, with moisture accumulating as snow. During spring and summer, snowmelt increases moisture availability, promoting plant growth and soil microbial activity, although this also carries the risk of flooding and methane (CH4) production under anoxic conditions. As temperatures rise and precipitation patterns change, new environmental conditions arise, affecting C fixation, storage, and release with feedbacks to the Earth System.

We aim to address critical aspects of the C cycle in the poorly studied high-elevation and latitude ecosystems of the Southern Hemisphere during freeze/thaw and altered precipitation events. We will integrate innovative lab and field measures with recent historical remote sensing data to predict C cycling in the decades to come.

## The data

We have set up 6 sites for monitoring microclimatic variables soil temperature, air temperature, and air moisture:  
- Cerro Mirador in the city of Punta Arenas, Chile (53 ºS)
- Yendegaia National Park in Tierra del Fuego, Chile (54 ºS)
- Peatlands in Puerto Williams, Chile (54 ºS)
- Cerro Bandera in Puerto Williams, Chile (54 ºS)
- Hornos Island in the Cape Horn National Park, Chile (55 ºS)
- Admiralty Bay, Arctowski Station (Poland), King George Island, Antarctica (62 ºS) at sea level.
- Admiralty Bay, Arctowski Station (Poland), King George Island, Antarctica (62 ºS) at Puchalski Point (~50 masl).

In the repository, you can find data for Cerro Mirador and Arctowski for nearly a year (2024-2025).
